## Who am i?

- 🌱 I’m currently learning.

- 🔭 I’m going to study for a master's degree.

- 🧶 I'm also maintaining my Neovim configuration.

- 😎 Sometimes I also write a little experience.

## What now?

- ⚡ Fun fact: Due to personal ability issues, my Neovim configuration is basically a large number of replicas of LazyVim, with a small amount being written by myself. However, I am also unable to solve certain deep-seated problems.

- 💬 I don't quite understand the content of Lua either.

## What about the future?

- 🤔 I plan to visit more excellent content on GitHub and learn from numerous excellent cases of developers.

- 😶‍🌫️ I plan to delve deeper into a development language, probably C++, and also learn scripting languages such as Lua and Python. Wait for my good news.
